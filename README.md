# tdx

Parse A-share market data feeds provided by [TDX] for historical prices
of shares trading on Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchange.

 * Download from http://www.tdx.com.cn/list_66_69.html

**NOTE**: This project has been rewritten in Go. For the legacy Ruby
codebase, Refer to the [ruby] branch.
